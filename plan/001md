```
import playwrightSpannerAssert from 'playwright-spanner-assert';
test.describe('example-01-basic-setup', () => {
  test('Database Validation', async () => {
    await playwrightSpannerAssert.validateDatabaseState('expected-data.yaml');
    await playwrightSpannerAssert.validateDatabaseState('');
  });
});
```
The goal is to provide a library that can validate database records from within a test file.
This should be published as an npm package.
Connection details should be stored in playwright-spanner-assert.yaml along with schema files and database names.

Keep the structure as simple as possible so it stays maintainable by composing small modules.
After installing the npm package, we want to validate database data in tests as shown above.
The actual validation logic should rely on spalidate.
